<h1>Consistent and flexible thermodynamics in atmospheric models using internal energy as a thermodynamic potential. Part 1: Equilibrium regime</h1>
<p>Approximations in the moist thermodynamics of atmospheric models are often inconsistent.
Different parts of numerical models may handle the thermodynamics in different ways, or the approximations may disagree with the laws of thermodynamics.
To address these problems all relevant thermodynamic quantities may be derived from a defined thermodynamic potential; approximations are then instead made to the potential itself --- this guarantees self-consistency, as well as flexibility.
Previous work showed that this concept is viable for vapour and liquid water mixtures in a moist atmospheric system using the Gibbs potential.
However, on extension to include the ice phase an ambiguity is encountered at the triple-point.
To resolve this ambiguity, here the internal energy potential is used instead.
Constrained maximisation methods on the entropy can be used to solve for the system equilibrium state; although, a further extension is necessary for atmospheric systems.
In the Earth’s atmosphere many important non-equilibrium processes take place; for example, freezing of super-cooled water, and evaporation into subsaturated air.
To fully capture processes such as these, the equilibrium method must be reformulated to involve finite rates of approach towards equilibrium.
Here the principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics are used, beginning with a set of phenomenological equations, to show how non-equilibrium moist processes may be coupled to a semi-implicit semi-Lagrangian dynamical core.
A standard bubble test case and simulations of idealised cloudy thermals are presented to demonstrate the viability of the approach for equilibrium thermodynamics.
Further details and results for non-equilibrium regimes are presented in a companion paper.</p>
<h1>Consistent and flexible thermodynamics in atmospheric models using internal energy as a thermodynamic potential. Part 2: Non-equilibrium regime</h1>
<p>Quantifying the entropy production within the climate system is important for many
physical processes. If all entropy producing processes can be properly enumerated then
the thermodynamics of the system is captured in its entirety. While it is possible to use
the Gibbs potential for moist systems without ice, it has been shown in a companion
paper that for the inclusion of ice the internal energy potential is preferred. We draw
on the theory and numerical model developed in part 1, where the thermodynamics is
shown coupled to a semi-Lagrangian semi-implicit model. Where the model concerned
was only demonstrated under the equilibrium regime, we expand on this to the realm of
non-equilibrium processes. Various non-equilibrium processes are important sources of
entropy in the atmosphere. For example, frictional dissipation, freezing of super-cooled
water, evaporation, condensation, ice crystal growth. In regards to these processes there
are a number of resistivities that can be associated with the thermodynamic ‘forces’.
These resistivities must be enumerated in order to get the correct behaviour of the various
system fluxes. While the pathway to do so is not immediately obvious, we find that it is
possible to equate typical mass and heat fluxes to the phenomenological equations and
therefore find the unknown resistivities. This may be done for all microphysics regimes
of concern, and here we do so for a number of simple cases, e.g. liquid particles, ice
particles, mixed-phase particles. Simulations of idealised cloudy thermals are presented
to compare the equilibrium to the non-equilibrium case.</p>
